Installation
============

Install with pip
::::::::::::::::

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ pip install bonobo

Install from source
:::::::::::::::::::

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/python-bonobo/bonobo.git@master#egg=bonobo

Editable install
::::::::::::::::

If you plan on making patches to Bonobo, you should install it as an "editable" package.


.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ pip install --editable git+https://github.com/python-bonobo/bonobo.git@master#egg=bonobo

Note: `-e` is the shorthand version of `--editable`.


Windows support
:::::::::::::::

We had some people report that there are problems on the windows platform, mostly due to terminal features. We're trying
to look into that but we don't have good windows experience, no windows box and not enough energy to provide serious
support there. If you have experience in this domain and you're willing to help, you're more than welcome!


.. todo::

    Better install docs, especially on how to use different forks or branches, etc.
