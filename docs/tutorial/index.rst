First steps
===========

We tried hard to make **Bonobo** simple. We use simple python, and we believe it should be simple to learn.

We strongly advice that even if you're an advanced python developper, you go through the whole tutorial for two
reasons: that should be sufficient to do anything possible with **Bonobo** and that's a good moment to learn the few
concepts you'll see everywhere in the software.
