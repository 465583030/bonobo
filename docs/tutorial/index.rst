First steps
===========

We tried hard to make **Bonobo** simple. We use simple python, and we believe it should be simple to learn.

Tutorial
::::::::

We strongly advice that even if you're an advanced python developper, you go through the whole tutorial for two
reasons: that should be sufficient to do anything possible with **Bonobo** and that's a good moment to learn the few
concepts you'll see everywhere in the software.

If you're not familiar with python, you should first read :doc:`./python`.
