What is Bonobo?
:::::::::::::::

Bonobo is an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) framework for python 3.5. The goal is to define data-transformations, with
python code in charge of handling similar shaped independent lines of data.

Bonobo *is not* a statistical or data-science tool. If you're looking for a data-analysis tool in python, use Pandas.

Bonobo is a lean manufacturing assembly line for data that let you focus on the actual work instead of the plumbery
(execution contexts, parallelism, error handling, console output, logging, ...).

Bonobo uses simple python and should be quick and easy to learn.
