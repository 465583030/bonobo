First steps
===========

Bonobo uses simple python and should be quick and easy to learn.

What is Bonobo?
:::::::::::::::

Bonobo is an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) framework for python 3.5. The goal is to define data-transformations, with
python code in charge of handling similar shaped independant lines of data.

Bonobo *is not* a statistical or data-science tool. If you're looking for a data-analysis tool in python, use Pandas.

Bonobo is a lean manufacturing assembly line for data that let you focus on the actual work instead of the plumbery.
