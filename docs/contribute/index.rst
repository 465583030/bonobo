Contributing
============

Contributing to bonobo is simple. Although we don't have a complete guide on this topic for now, the best way is to fork
the github repository and send pull requests.

Keep the following points in mind:

* Although we will ask for 100% backward compatibility starting from 1.0 (following semantic versionning principles),
  pre-1.0 versions should do their best to keep compatibility between versions. Wehn in doubt, open a github issue
  to discuss things.
* The core should stay as light as possible.
* Coding standards are enforced using yapf. That means that you can code the way you want, we just ask you to run
  `make format` before committing your changes so everybody follows the same conventions.
* General rule for anything you're not sure about is "open a github issue to discuss the point".
* More formal proposal process will come the day we feel the need for it.

A very drafty roadmap is available in the readme.
